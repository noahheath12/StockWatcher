Building a web application using Google Web Toolkit(GWT) is simple. With all of the installed drivers, it is as simple as creating a new GWT project, and pointing and clicking. When you create a new project, there is auto generated source code. There are also two different views. The one that will make your life easy is the “Design” view. Once you click there, you have panels that you can navigate and create your app. It’s a simple as dragging and dropping items into the far right pane and editing the properties on the pane. The properties panel is located on the left hand side. From there you can set variable names, set text properties, and even style using CSS.
